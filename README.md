# NexaPlayer üéµ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

- A sleek, minimalist media player built with **Python, PySide6, and python-vlc.** 
- It‚Äôs designed to be lightweight, modern, and visually distinctive. I originally created it to make streaming videos through VLC easier‚Äîespecially when sharing on Discord‚Äîso I could watch along without constantly resizing the window (which otherwise reduces stream quality).

## üöÄ Features

- **VLC engine:** Reliable audio/video playback via VLC.
- **Clean UI:** PySide6 (Qt) interface with custom-styled controls.
- **Dual modes:** Main window and mini-player, both synced.
- **Shortcuts:** hide the mini player's HUD with H, press F for Fullscreen, and navigate the video with the arrow keys.
